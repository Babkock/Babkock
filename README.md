I am a self-taught programmer and computer scientist. I work in the languages of C, C++, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Rust, and I use Void Linux as a daily driver. I am also fluent in Java, HTML/CSS, MySQL, and Bash shell. I maintain [my own website](https://tannerbabcock.com/home). I'm also an artist, YouTuber, and I manage a small record label. This document has all of my social media links, links to my music projects, and links to my Dotfiles. Most of my repositories are mirrored on my [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/Babkock/).

You can see my [web development homework](https://tannerbabcock.com/homework/index) live on my website. Since 2022 I have been making videos for YouTube and streaming on Twitch.
